- **Shared Chunks**: 99.7 kB (React, Next.js runtime)
- **Static Assets**: Optimized fonts and minimal image assets

### Code Splitting Strategy
- Route-based splitting (automatic with Next.js)
- Component-level splitting for heavy 3D components
- Dynamic imports for Three.js helper libraries

## 🧪 Quality Assurance Strategy

### Current Quality Measures
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time type checking
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency checks
- **Build Verification**: Automated build testing for deployment readiness

### Recommended Future Testing
- Unit tests for utility functions and data processing
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency

## 🚀 Deployment & Infrastructure

### Build Process
1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Type checking and transpilation
2. **Next.js Optimization**: Automatic bundle splitting and optimization
3. **Asset Processing**: Image optimization and compression

### Future Scaling Strategies
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket integration for live data streams
- **Server-side Processing**: Move heavy calculations to server
- **CDN Strategy**: Distribute 3D assets and textures globally
- **Progressive Loading**: Load datasets incrementally for better UX

## 📈 Data Processing Architecture

### Realistic Latency Calculation
```typescript
// Physics-based latency calculation
const lightSpeed = 200000; // km/s in fiber optic cable
const baseLatency = (distance / lightSpeed) * 1000;

// Add realistic network overhead
const networkOverhead = Math.random() * 20 + 5; // 5-25ms
const routingDelay = Math.random() * 10 + 2;    // 2-12ms
const processingDelay = Math.random() * 5 + 1;  // 1-6ms

return Math.round(baseLatency + networkOverhead + routingDelay + processingDelay);
```

### Geographic Distance Calculation
```typescript
// Haversine formula for accurate Earth distance calculation
function calculateDistance(lat1: number, lng1: number, lat2: number, lng2: number): number {
  const R = 6371; // Earth's radius in kilometers
  const dLat = ((lat2 - lat1) * Math.PI) / 180;
  const dLng = ((lng2 - lng1) * Math.PI) / 180;
  // ... implementation
  return R * c;
}
```

## 🎨 Design System Implementation

- **Backdrop Blur**: `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` for glass effects
- **Transparency**: `rgba(17, 24, 39, 0.6)` for consistent panel opacity
- **Border Styling**: Subtle borders with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`

### Animation Framework
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
